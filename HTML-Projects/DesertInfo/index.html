            <p>
                Desert is a barren area of landscape where little precipitation occurs and, consequently, living
                conditions are hostile
                for plant and animal life. The lack of vegetation exposes the unprotected surface of the ground to the
                processes of
                denudation. About one-third of the land surface of the Earth is arid or semi-arid. This includes much of
                the polar
                regions, where little precipitation occurs, and which are sometimes called polar deserts or "cold
                deserts". Deserts can
                be classified by the amount of precipitation that falls, by the temperature that prevails, by the causes
                of
                desertification or by their geographical location.

            <h2>How are they formed?</h2>
            <img src="./imgs/daniele-colucci-OtXJhYjbKeg-unsplash.jpg" alt="Desert">
            <p>
                Deserts are formed by weathering processes as large variations in temperature between day and night put
                strains on
                the
                rocks which consequently break in pieces. Although rain seldom occurs in deserts, there are occasional
                downpours
                that
                can result in flash floods. Rain falling on hot rocks can cause them to shatter and the resulting
                fragments and
                rubble
                strewn over the desert floor is further eroded by the wind. This picks up particles of sand and dust and
                wafts them
                aloft in sand or dust storms. Wind-blown sand grains striking any solid object in their path can abrade
                the surface.
                Rocks are smoothed down, and the wind sorts sand into uniform deposits. The grains end up as level
                sheets of sand or
                are
                piled high in billowing sand dunes.

            <h2>Some Fun Facts about Deserts</h2>

            <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Deserts generally receive less than 40cm (16in) of rain a year.</li>
                <li>Sure, our planet looks like a watery blue marble from space, but one-third of Earth’s land surface
                    is partially or
                    totally desert.</li>
                <li>There are parts of the Atacama Desert in Chile where no rain has ever been recorded. Scientists
                    believe portions of the
                    region have been in an extreme desert state for 40 million years — longer than any other place on
                    Earth.</li>
                <li>Only around 20% of the deserts on Earth are covered in sand.</li>
                <li>The largest cold desert on Earth is Antarctica.The largest hot desert on Earth is the Sahara.</li>
            </ul>
